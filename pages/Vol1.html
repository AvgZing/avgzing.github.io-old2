<p>Though my interests fluctuate quite a lot, something I'll always say is Minecraft. Much of my gameplay is on my bedrock realm called Oakridge: Survival Unhinged. <a href="https://discord.gg/MgWstZR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apply here!</a>. You can also find me working on programming, so I helped to found BoxOfDevs, which continues now as a discord dev community.<a href="https://discord.gg/adFhNCQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Join here!</a>.</p>
